# Subsum Product Document

# **1️⃣ Product Vision**

Subsum exists to give young professionals immediate clarity over their recurring spending — without requiring bank connections, complexity, or financial dashboards.

It is not a budgeting app.

It is not a finance platform.

It is a clarity tool.

The vision:

> Make subscription spending visible, predictable, and emotionally manageable.
> 

The product should feel:

- Calm
- Controlled
- Honest
- Minimal
- Trustworthy

Not:

- Corporate
- Overwhelming
- Gamified
- Financially preachy

---

# **2️⃣ Target Persona (Locked)**

**Primary Persona:**

Young professionals (22–35) with 5–20 digital subscriptions who:

- Forget what they’re paying for
- Feel mild anxiety about recurring charges
- Don’t want to connect their bank
- Want fast clarity, not a financial dashboard
- Are comfortable paying for quality apps

Psychological triggers:

- “How much am I actually spending per month?”
- “Why did I get charged again?”
- “I need to review my subscriptions.”

They are not trying to build wealth.

They want awareness and control.

---

# **3️⃣ Core Problem Statement**

Recurring digital subscriptions accumulate silently.

People:

- Underestimate total monthly spend
- Forget renewal dates
- Get surprised by charges
- Lose track of yearly costs

Existing solutions:

- Overcomplicate
- Require bank integration
- Look like accounting software
- Try to upsell financial services

There is a gap for:

A lightweight, private, manual subscription clarity tool.

---

# **4️⃣ Value Proposition (Precise & Monetizable)**

Subsum shows you:

- Your true monthly subscription total
- Your projected yearly spend
- Upcoming charges before they hit
- Which subscriptions cost you the most

Without:

- Bank login
- Data scraping
- Ads
- Financial clutter

Primary benefit:

> No more surprise charges.
> 

Secondary benefit:

> Know exactly what your digital life costs you.
> 

---

# **5️⃣ Positioning Sentence (For App Store)**

Short version:

“Track your subscriptions and see your real monthly spend — instantly.”

Longer version:

“Subsum helps you track recurring subscriptions, avoid surprise charges, and see exactly how much you spend each month — without connecting your bank.”

---

## **6️⃣ Monetization Architecture (Revenue Blueprint)**

Subsum is not a freemium afterthought.

Monetization is built into the psychological flow.

The goal is not to restrict usage.

The goal is to unlock deeper clarity.

---

### **Free Tier (Core Utility)**

Users can:

- Add unlimited subscriptions
- See total monthly spend
- See upcoming charges
- Receive basic reminder (1 day before charge)
- View simple list of subscriptions

Free version gives awareness.

It does not give advanced insight.

---

### **Pro Tier (Clarity Upgrade)**

Pro unlocks:

- Yearly spend projection
- Advanced insights (category breakdown, trends)
- Custom reminder timing (1–7 days before)
- FaceID / biometric lock
- CSV export
- Widgets
- Advanced filters

Pro is positioned as:

“Upgrade your financial clarity.”

Not:

“Remove limits.”

---

### **Psychological Upgrade Trigger**

The emotional moment:

After a user adds 3+ subscriptions and sees:

“You’re spending €142/month.”

We show:

“You’ll spend €1,704 this year.”

The yearly number is blurred or partially hidden.

Tapping it opens the Pro screen with a 7-day trial.

The trial is triggered by insight curiosity, not interruption.

---

### **Trial Strategy**

- 7-day free trial
- Strong emphasis on yearly plan
- Yearly pricing positioned as “2 months free” equivalent

No aggressive popups on first launch.

Clarity first.

Monetization second.

Conversion through realization.

---

This section is critical because it dictates:

- Onboarding design
- Screen hierarchy
- Feature prioritization
- Paywall timing

---

# **7️⃣ Onboarding Flow & First-Time Experience**

Onboarding is not a tutorial.

It is emotional priming.

The goal is to make users realize:

“I probably don’t know how much I’m actually spending.”

Not to explain features.

---

## **Onboarding Structure (Max 3 Screens)**

### **Screen 1 — Emotional Hook**

Headline:

**“Subscriptions add up.”**

Subtext:

“Streaming, apps, cloud storage, tools — small payments become big monthly totals.”

Visual:

Clean animation of small recurring charges stacking into a larger number.

CTA:

**Continue**

No sign-up.

No account.

No friction.

---

### **Screen 2 — The Pain**

Headline:

**“Most people underestimate their subscriptions.”**

Subtext:

“See your real monthly total. Stay ahead of upcoming charges.”

Visual:

Mock preview of the Overview screen:

- €184/month
- Upcoming charges
- Clean, calm UI

CTA:

**Start Tracking**

Still no paywall.

---

### **Screen 3 — Privacy Assurance**

Headline:

**“No bank connection required.”**

Subtext:

“Subsum works manually. Your data stays on your device.”

This removes friction for users who fear financial aggregation apps.

CTA:

**Add Your First Subscription**

---

## **First Action Experience**

Immediately after onboarding:

User lands on:

**Add Subscription screen.**

Fields:

- Name
- Price
- Billing frequency
- Next charge date
- Optional category

Keep it minimal.

No clutter.

No optional advanced settings.

---

## **First “Aha” Moment**

After adding 1 subscription:

Overview shows monthly total.

After adding 3+ subscriptions:

Overview feels real.

When they see:

“You’re spending €142/month”

That’s the emotional trigger.

---

## **Insight Tease (Upgrade Entry Point)**

Below the monthly total:

Card:

“You’ll spend €1,704 this year.”

Blurred value or partially masked.

Tap → Opens Pro paywall with 7-day trial.

No pushy modal.

No forced upgrade.

Curiosity-driven conversion.

---

## **Important Rules**

- No paywall during onboarding.
- No paywall before value.
- No aggressive popups.
- No feature explanation walls.
- Let the numbers create tension.

---

# **8️⃣ UX Architecture & Screen Structure**

Subsum must feel simple at first glance but intelligent underneath.

We are not building a financial dashboard.

We are building a clarity surface.

---

## **Navigation Structure**

Bottom Tab Bar (4 tabs):

1️⃣ Overview

2️⃣ Subscriptions

3️⃣ Insights

4️⃣ Settings

Clean icons.

No labels that feel corporate.

Minimal wording.

---

## **1️⃣ Overview (Primary Screen)**

This is the emotional core of the app.

It must show immediately:

### **Hero Section**

- Large monthly total (dominant number)
- Subtle label: “Monthly Total”
- Secondary annual projection (blurred if not Pro)

Example:

€184

/month

Below:

“You’ll spend €2,208 this year”

(blurred for free users)

---

### **Upcoming Charges Section**

List next 3–5 upcoming renewals:

- Netflix – €15 – in 2 days
- iCloud – €2.99 – in 5 days

This reinforces urgency and value.

---

### **Upgrade Tease Card (Free Users Only)**

A clean, subtle card:

“Unlock yearly insights & advanced reminders.”

Not aggressive.

Not full-screen.

Integrated naturally.

---

## **2️⃣ Subscriptions Screen**

Clean list view.

Each item shows:

- Icon (app/service logo or color tile)
- Name
- Price + billing frequency
- Next charge date

Swipe Actions:

- Edit
- Delete

Floating “+” button to add new subscription.

No analytics here.

No clutter.

---

## **3️⃣ Insights Screen**

Free users see:

- Locked insights preview

Pro users see:

- Category breakdown (pie chart)
- Monthly trend graph (Swift Charts)
- Most expensive subscriptions
- Spending growth month-to-month

This screen must feel:

Premium.

Data-light.

Not corporate.

---

## **4️⃣ Settings**

- Notification settings
- Reminder timing (Pro)
- Currency selection
- FaceID lock (Pro)
- Export CSV (Pro)
- Manage subscription (Apple IAP)
- Privacy statement

Keep it boring and functional.

---

# **UX Principles (Non-Negotiable)**

- Numbers dominate the interface
- Avoid financial jargon
- No dense tables
- No dark “bank app” aesthetic
- Use spacing generously
- Animations should feel calm and deliberate

---

# **Emotional Flow Summary**

User journey:

1. Add subscriptions
2. See monthly total
3. Feel slight discomfort
4. Notice blurred yearly projection
5. Tap out of curiosity
6. Trial → Upgrade

That is the engine.

---

# **9️⃣ Data Model & Technical Architecture**

Subsum must be architected cleanly from day one.

No feature sprawl.

No accidental complexity.

No hidden logic.

We define the core data layer first.

---

## **Core Entities**

### **1️⃣ Subscription**

This is the primary model.

Fields:

- id (UUID)
- name (String)
- amount (Decimal)
- currency (String)
- billingFrequency (Enum)
- nextChargeDate (Date)
- category (Enum / String)
- createdAt (Date)
- isActive (Bool)

BillingFrequency enum:

- monthly
- yearly
- weekly
- custom(days: Int)

---

### **2️⃣ UserSettings**

Stores app-level preferences.

Fields:

- currency
- defaultReminderDays
- isProUser
- biometricLockEnabled
- notificationsEnabled

---

### **3️⃣ Derived Calculations (Not Stored)**

These must NOT be stored — they are computed:

- Monthly total
- Yearly projection
- Upcoming charges (next 30 days)
- Category totals
- Most expensive subscription
- Month-over-month growth

This keeps the system clean.

---

## **Data Storage Choice**

For v1:

Use **SwiftData** (or CoreData if needed).

Why:

- Local-only architecture
- No backend required
- Fast development
- Clean SwiftUI integration
- Scalable later if iCloud sync is added

No cloud.

No accounts.

No server.

---

## **Notification Logic**

For each Subscription:

- When saved or edited:
    - Schedule local notification
    - Based on nextChargeDate
    - Using user-selected reminder offset (1–7 days)

When date passes:

- Auto-calculate next charge date
- Re-schedule notification

This logic must be centralized in a NotificationManager.

---

## **In-App Purchase Architecture**

Use StoreKit 2.

Product types:

- Monthly subscription
- Yearly subscription (primary recommended)
- 7-day free trial attached to subscription

Pro state must be validated locally with:

- StoreKit entitlement check
- Fallback refresh logic

---

## **Feature Gating Logic**

If isProUser == false:

- Blur yearly projection
- Lock Insights screen
- Disable custom reminder timing
- Disable export
- Disable biometric lock

Do NOT hard-limit number of subscriptions.

---

## **App Architecture Pattern**

Keep it simple:

- SwiftUI
- MVVM structure
- Separate:
    - Models
    - ViewModels
    - Views
    - Managers (NotificationManager, PurchaseManager)

No complex architecture patterns.

No premature abstraction.

---

## **v1 Non-Negotiable Technical Principles**

- No third-party SDKs
- No analytics SDK initially
- No backend
- No login
- No bank APIs

Ship fast.

Stay clean.
